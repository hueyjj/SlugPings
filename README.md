# SlugPings
A live, interactive map where users place markers to ping an event occuring on campus.

Live demo: https://slugpings.herokuapp.com/


Two main source directories: 

    SlugPings (https://github.com/hueyjj/SlugPings)
    SlugPingsDatabase (https://github.com/hueyjj/SlugPingsDatabase)

Both directories will be served on Heroku. The reason is because Heroku (free users at least) cannot use more than one port on one Heroku server.

Example

    our-heroku-name.herokuapps.com/
    our-heroku-name.herokuapps.com:1245/
We cannot use port 1245.

Our workaround will be to use one heroku server to serve our website front-end. This will also include some back-end logic.
And we will use one other heroku server to handle our database. The database we will use is redis (https://redis.io/).
